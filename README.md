Active GUI
=========

Active GUI is a javascript animation and display library built from the ground up. It works as an embedable platform and it also works with almost every major browser both desktop and mobile. It allows you to create fluid animations, manipulate DOM objects, replace content on the fly, and more. Best of all it's free!
